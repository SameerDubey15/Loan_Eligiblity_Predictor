# Loan Eligibility Predictor
This repository contains the code and data for a data analysis project on loan eligibility prediction. The project was conducted as part of a data science course at DevTown.

## The data set contains information on 30,000 loan applications, including the following features:
1. Loan ID
2. Gender
3. Marital Status
4. Education
5. Number of Dependents
6. Income
7. Loan Amount
8. Credit History
9. Property Area
10. Loan Status

## Analysis
The data was analyzed using a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques. 

## The following are some of the key findings of the analysis:
1. The most important factors in determining loan eligibility are income, credit history, and property area.
2. Applicants with higher incomes, good credit histories, and properties in urban areas are more likely to be approved for loans.
3. The gender, marital status, and education of the applicant have a less significant impact on loan eligibility.

## Model Development
A variety of machine learning models were developed to predict loan eligibility. The best performing model was a logistic regression model, which achieved an accuracy of 80%.
